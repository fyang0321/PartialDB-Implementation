1.Design decisions
We implemented LRU page eviction policy. The idea is essentially a HashmapLinkedlist in Java API. citation: http://www.programcreek.com/2013/03/leetcode-lru-cache-java/
For the join, it’s a nested-loop join.


2.Changes
We do change the API. Only three more private methods added in the implementation of LRU policy.


3.Incomplete elements
All tests are passed, nothing misses.


4.How long we spend on project
I spent 20 hours on this project. The confusing part is the implementation
